### Wait, what?

The project is like a small, self-contained operating system layered on top of your actual operating system. [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) provides the background theme, which makes the programs potentially amusing, interesting or touching. People can add programs at will. It's an open-ended process without deadlines or a final goal and we're very open to ideas, programming languages and **all** people. If you like coding and xkcd too, please consider joining the project!
